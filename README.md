WisQuas (Reveal) - version: 0.8

=============================================================================

Inspiration...
http://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Reveal

"Wis Quas strips illusion from creatures hidden by the cloak of invisibility, instantly revealing their position. Nightshade cut many times to form a paper-like sheet, then carved into lace is secured by spider silk. It is glazed, dried in the sun, then crystallized into a shiny powder that must be tossed in the sky over the field of battle as the spell is cast."
